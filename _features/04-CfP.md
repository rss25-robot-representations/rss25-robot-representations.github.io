Participants are invited to submit an extended abstract or short papers (up to 4 pages in RSS format) focusing on novel advances in 3D scene understanding, predicate/affordance reasoning, high-level planning and at the boundary between these research areas.

**Important dates:** (deadlines are <a href="https://time.is/Anywhere_on_Earth">AoE</a> on the respective date)
- Submission deadline: ~~May 22~~ June 30
- Acceptance notification
  - For papers submitted before May 22: June 16

- Camera ready submission: ~~June 23~~ June 30
- Workshop date: July 10, 2023

**Topics of interest** include but are not limited to:

- Novel algorithms for spatial perception that combine geometry, semantics, and context;
- Approaches to learning and structuring contextual knowledge from complex sensory inputs;
- Techniques for reasoning over spatial, semantic, and temporal aspects for long-horizon planning;
- Approaches that combine learning-based techniques with geometric and model-based estimation methods; and
- Position papers and unconventional ideas on how to reach human-level performance in robot scene understanding, task planning and execution. 

Contributed papers will be reviewed by the organizers and a program committee of invited reviewers. Accepted papers will be published on the workshop website and will be featured in spotlight presentations and poster sessions.
